📊 Power BI Dashboards
Welcome to my Power BI dashboard collection! This repository showcases my hands-on experience in data visualization and business intelligence through three unique projects:

1. 🛍️ Superstore Sales Analysis - Dashboard 1 & 2
These dashboards provide deep insights into a fictional retail dataset using advanced Power BI features:

Dashboard 1 focuses on regional sales performance, profit margins, and category-wise trends.

Dashboard 2 adds interactive visuals to compare customer segments, shipping performance, and time-series trends.

2. 🎬 Disney+ Analysis Dashboard
A fun and visually rich dashboard inspired by Disney+, analyzing show popularity, ratings, genre trends, and viewer engagement.

Created using a custom dataset and a Disney-style design aesthetic.

Focus on storytelling with charts and color themes resembling the Disney brand.
